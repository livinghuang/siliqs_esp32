/*
We use a forked version of the RadioLib library (original repository: https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) to implement the LoRaWAN service.
Our fork includes modifications to support the AS923_1 band, which is not available in the original library.
When operating in the AS923_1 band, the transmission frequencies are as follows:
923.200 MHz,923.400 MHz,923.600 MHz,923.800 MHz,924.000 MHz,924.200 MHz,924.400 MHz,924.600 MHz
The source code for these modifications can be found in the file src/radiolab/src/protocols/LoRaWAN/LoRaWANBands.cpp.
